[Music] texas has become an incredibly exciting place politically for a couple of different reasons the first is in the very short term how things are looking for the presidential election obviously things can change but if you look at recent polls there i know that you probably can't read the specifics a lot of different polls over the course of the past two months or so with look a number saying that donald trump is up if not by as much as has happened in past presidential elections but others showing that joe biden is up including the last the ut tyler poll showing him up by five points so the sort of talk that's been going on for 15 or more years about texas potentially being in play at some point may be the case this time around but just because the you know the people are changing the numbers are changing the polls are changing doesn't mean that the gop is going to take this thing lying down take a look at this from ken hermann of the austin american statesman cites a part of the proposed texas gop platform planck saying state electoral college be it resolved that the state legislature shall cause to be enacted a state constitutional amendment creating an electoral college consisting of electors selected by the popular votes cast within each individual state senatorial district who shall then elect all statewide office holders so just as texas is potentially flipping so that you can win statewide as a democrat and democratic presidential candidates can potentially win there suddenly the popular vote i don't know about that maybe we need to set up something that's going to dilute that in a number of different ways which we'll discuss yes they are giving themselves a road map to meticulously do to texas something that had been done the only reason the electoral college is legal is because it's explicitly in the constitution every other device like that that's not in a constitution mississippi is the only one that i'm pretty sure mississippi is the only one that has something like this explicitly in their state constitution um but the supreme court has said this is this kind of thing is explicitly not allowed by the constitution unless it's explicitly mentioned in a constitution and it's not and that's why they're trying to amend the the state constitution to get that happen but i don't think you can add stuff anymore like this this is an attempt because i see in the last you know gore trump elections that the republicans lost the popular vote but won the electoral college in a way that warps democracy and when they try to say what america is a proud blank they say a proud democracy but when the people's voice isn't heard they have a really tough time backing that up and this a this crazy insane long sentence is exactly how they're trying to go about doing it exactly exactly i'll have a little bit more on the likelihood that it might you know stick around if they do pass it but just really fast in general why would this matter so you take a look at that and you think okay well you know if each senate say if each state senatorial district decides and then we distribute those does that really affect the outcome in a predictable way and the thing is that yes it does now in this case with texas not necessarily in the same way that it has in some other cases that have been struck down by the supreme court there was i think oklahoma a few decades ago they had a system like this with massive differences in the populations between state senatorial districts so that um it was effectively there were rural counties that counted for three times as much as the more urban counties that is a consideration here but it's also if you understand how gerrymandered texas is you can fit tons of one parties voters in particular state senate districts and then dilute or i guess concentrate them there so that way more districts have less of that party and so overall it's a way to warp i can see you want to jump in no for sure it is absolutely that like in in history just like not the ones you've listed but throughout history the things that have been voided by courts you're saying three to one like 40 to one they pack 40 times more people into one district than another and just go it's fine yeah the only reason i point out is that i i think that in texas with the state senate districts right now i think it is relatively similar total population wise based on the research i found but i want to make clear that people know that that's not the only way to manipulate things yeah um it is it is extraordinarily rough it is extraordinarily unfair and the thing is like for them gerrymandering isn't enough that's how desperate they are just gerrymandering isn't enough anymore yeah yeah and and think about it like well oh god things are changing man we've always been able to rely on texas and maybe we won't what can we do i mean hypothetically we could you know try to adopt some positions that texans would like now why don't we just totally change the way elections happen and take us another big step away from a real representative democracy let's do that and that's what they're choosing hypothetically it hasn't yet been put in the platform uh or as a plank in the platform and even if it does that doesn't necessarily mean that it'll be voted on but it could now what if what if they do well as brett pointed out mississippians could potentially strike down their version of this in november but we know that the supreme court which hypothetically this could go to at some point recently just this week left in place a lower court order that likely will prevent hundreds of thousands of ex-felons in florida from voting in the november election it's the fourth time that the court has refused to intervene to protect voting rights just this year you also have cases from wisconsin alabama and texas where they overruled lower court decisions that sought to allow more absentee ballot voting so just because it is extremely clear the precedent that this sort of thing is not constitutional does not mean that the supreme court is actually going to continue to follow that precedent they could very well overthrow it if these are if you have five partisan justices who believe that a republican can't win a presidential election if texas goes for the democrats are they gonna hold to some court case from a few decades ago maybe but maybe not yeah it's uh the more you hear about that florida case the more frustrating it gets because that was that was a voter referendum so the people who could vote not counting the 800 000 that whose votes would be added to the voter rule of the people who could vote for that it was something like 66 percent like it wasn't close everybody like a that a super majority of voters said no i'm fine with this i am fine with more people voting as long as they have you know then they get out of jail um at prison and that and for a lot of these things the more you read through it they find some kind of technicality and this still could go on like there still could just them refusing to hear it doesn't mean that the the fight is over but it definitely delays the fight through november as as you mentioned yeah okay with that 100 000 people 800 000 people could i mean very easily swing florida the idea that of the existing potential voters trump is having that heart of time in florida shows how hard a time he's having exactly yeah and people should understand that you know since we're talking about the florida one um some people the reason they decided to set up effectively a poll tax before these um newly re-enfranchised but then disenfranchised uh felons can vote is some people hear that and think oh well yeah i guess if they owe fees they could just pay the fees that seems reasonable enough but the other reason that the republicans chose this tactic is that they know that there is no centralized system to figure out what fees you owe or who you owe them to so you can have potentially hundreds of thousands of ex-felons who are like i want to pay my fines but there is literally no way for me to do that and the republicans say yeah system's complicated might take like six years to fix we'll get around to it at some point it's designed to make it impossible for them to vote that's all it's there for and the supreme court sees that they get all this evidence and they say nope we like what the gop is doing in florida we're going to allow them to continue to stop those people from voting and so that is why i'm very concerned about these sorts of things becoming more common in texas sure but potentially in other places as well we've seen that when republicans lose for instance governor's seats but they still have the legislature or they're about to lose the legislature they just strip away the powers before they go and so the the assault against democracy is coming in many different forms and it's only going to get hotter as they become more and more unpopular nationally [Music] check out the damage warp podcast each day wherever you get your podcast whether pocketcast
