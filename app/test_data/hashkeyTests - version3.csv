According to Parkinson, these men chose to prosecute the American war for independence in a way that put race at the heart of the matter. <strong>They used</strong>—actually helped foment—<strong>racial prejudice as the principal means of creating unity across the thirteen colonies</strong> in order to prepare Americans to do battle with Great Britain. The base sentiments they promoted for “political expediency” survived the fighting, and the <strong>“narrative” that dismissed blacks and Native peoples as alien to America—and conflated “white” and “citizen”</strong>—“lived at the heart of the republic it helped create for decades to come.”</p>
