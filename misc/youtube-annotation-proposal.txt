Annotating YouTube with Citations/Tweets

  * One of the problems with the current version of the web is that annotation tools are immature.
  * The siloing of conversations and poor annotation and citation tools leads to political dysfunction.
  * Video citations are an underdeveloped annotation medium, despite their central role in public media.
  * A good video annotation demo would be valuable to visualizing the benefits of a functional system.
  * The recent Trump rally has promted many citations on twitter and could serve as a good demo video.

Youtube Player proposal:

  * When the YouTube player plays, javascript could trigger an event when
  * the video reaches particular timestamps. (see code below at letter d)
  
  * This event could query a list of all tweets/comments related to that timestamp
  * The transcript below could be paired with timestamps from the YouTube-dl script


  1) The javascript code could periodically call the player.getCurrentTime() and
	reload the list of citations (or tweets) near the current timestamp
	
  2) Javascript could also cross reference with the auto-generated YouTube transcript

hear me [Music] is [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] ladies and gentlemen please welcome so the president heard some patriots were coming to town and he looked at that and saw all you people online and all the pictures and the videos and guess what now he wants to be here with you because he is the president of the people for many years americans have taken the back seat to politicians to special interests and they couldn't believe it because we finally had someone that was gonna put america first and i gotta admit i don't think they thought he'd really do it but you know what they found out the hard way because he doesn't owe anyone for getting him here because you put him right here in the white house we were all there through this 2020 election cycle we've seen these crowds unlike you know joe biden and his six the guy couldn't even get a thousand views online but we're supposed to believe i mean come on nobody really believes this crap but hey there's something going on at the capitol today this movement started over a decade ago house and even if they think for a second that they're going to get away they got another thing coming because today is just a day i have probably crossed paths with all of you over the last 10 years but i think those politicians down there the republican politicians down there have forgotten what the tea party movement did back then see they forgot that americans know their rights americans will stand up for themselves and protect their rights and they will demand that the politicians that we elect uphold those rights or we will go so you better believe oh the next two years we are watching today we are taking names today and i don't know are you guys going to forget because today moving forward we have hundreds of days for them to hear from us for them to see us and for them to work on replacing them one by one if we have to president has sacrificed everything for this country and has asked for he loves the united states of america [Music] he loves god he loves our flag and he loves all of you and i gotta tell you i've never seen someone fight so hard so strong against everything here and abroad just to provide and protect our basic values and principles that keep our nation free and are people able to go to church because they have forgotten at the end of the day these politicians are not in charge they govern we are revoking that consent moving forward and we are going to fight for our president we're going to fight for our country and i guarantee you in two years every politician that turned their back on our country will lose their seat including democrats so i am so excited to be here with all of you being one of the original founders of the tea party movement traveling to every state in this country meeting grassroots over the last 12 years has truly been my honor to do everything that i can to make your voices heard and i pledge to continue to doing that for all of you for our children and our grandchildren because here's the deal guys the left they go out there and they scream and cry and they whine but let me tell this is something they don't get either let me tell you they haven't seen a resistance until they have seen a patriot fight for their country [Applause] because we know how to fight for our country and we're not going to complain we're not going to we're not going to cry in the streets we're not going to go sit in you're going to see us and you're going to hear us but we're going to be working we're going to fight in our state legislatures to get rid of electronic voting we want ballots we want election integrity we want to restore the vote in our country because we all know they all know this election was severely compromised and we're going to make sure that that never happens again [Music] because i can see from here all the way back there are more of us than there are of them so god bless you all for coming out here and i am just so honored to introduce your next speaker she is a woman that i have known for a very long time who has fought for our country been a voice for liberty have stood up for all of those republican candidates that the establishment tried to fight tried to out fund and in some cases even supported democrats to keep a conservative liberty republican out of this city amy kramer is a woman who has this amazing organization called women for america first but she was also the 2016 she is fierce she is a fighter and after this election she took to the streets because that's what we do as patriots we fight we don't sit around and wait for politicians to act or judges to act we the people are in control of the united states and we are going to remind everyone that we are still a constitutional republic over the last two months this woman has traveled over 14 000 miles on this big red bus called march for trump have you heard going from city to city town to town in the snow in the rain working desperately to fight for all of you to give you a voice ladies and gentlemen today we are all in this together in this fight to restore america we will save america and amy kramer has been on the front lines and it is my pleasure to announce my friend and my sister oh my god decide to see i mean like katrina said as far back as i can see and i guess on all the side streets you know this president hasn't asked for much from us he's asked for our vote and he asked us to show up today and i don't think he's going to be disappointed [Music] you know there's so much at stake today we have been in the streets the past two months there's a movement that has been born i come from the tea party movement and i'm asked all the time what happened to the tea party well we're still here we just grew and morphed into something bigger and better the mega movement and i am convinced that we're not for the tea party movement we would not have president donald j he has fought for us and he unlike any other president in our lifetime has put america first and how refreshing is that we love him i know you do i just heard you chanting it and he loves us he is putting our country and the american people first and washington doesn't like it why because they're in the back pockets of china and russia and ukraine we've got their number we know what they're doing and i don't care what they say sleepy joe biden did not win this election i come from the great state of georgia that we're learning just how corrupt we are right now but sunday night before election day i was in this little northwest town of rome georgia we got there about noon that day and we saw thousands of people walking a mile over a mile to go see our president he was doing five rallies that day and rome georgia was the fourth one i think he showed up there at 8 30 9 o'clock that night but all day we watch these men and women two and three generations of families walking pushing elderly people in their wheelchairs elderly people on their walkers carrying their children on their shoulders all to see the president of the united states and they turned people away i think the the auditorium or the airport took 40 000 people that night and they turned people away and after it was over we watched them leave the airport and it took hours tears running down their faces their children asleep on their shoulders carrying their children walking people didn't get home until two or three in the morning the press likes to talk about how the people were stranded no those people weren't stranded they came there to see the president it took him longer to get in than to get out and it was worth every moment to see the president of the united states and we're seeing the same here thing here again today but the thing is you can't convince me after seeing those people in the crowds of that that day and all those rallies leading up to election day you can't convince me that a man who can't fill six circles won this election there is no way and as i look out here today this is probably the biggest party that the people have ever held for a president in hold your signs up let us see your signs it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what the media says they can call him president-elect that doesn't make it so right we know that there was voter fraud we absolutely know it and that's why first they say there's no voter fraud then they say there's no widespread voter fraud so they they can say that there's no voter fraud but see we know that there is we know that in pennsylvania 200 000 ballots more than 200 000 ballots were returned that weren't set out we know there's voter fraud in georgia do you know yesterday that suitcases were sold out across the state of georgia and look what happened last night just because the media doesn't tell you what's going on doesn't make it make it not true right one of president trump's legacies is his exposure of the fake news media but that doesn't just mean wrong and inaccurate information it's also the omission of information right but we're smarter than them we've connected in other ways we've connected via social media and now big tech is trying to silence us facebook has shut us down we're the group that started the stop the steel facebook group the day after the election and within 22 hours it had over 365 000 members and when they shut it down 1.2 million members in the queue waiting to be added that's amazing they've never seen anything like it in the tech world then mailchimp shuts us down so we can't communicate with our supporters and then eventbrite shuts us down but they didn't just shut us down they returned all of the donations and then sent emails to everybody that had signed up telling them that had been canceled but guess what that didn't stop you that didn't stop the people we showed up on november 14th because we love this country and we they thought they were going to silence us they thought they were going to stop us but then we came back again december 12th and another approximately one and a half million people showed up in washington d.c not because they thought they were going to hear from president trump or see president trump not because they thought they were going to hear from somebody with a trump last name but because they love this country and they love this president and they are committed to standing for election integrity so women for america first decided to get on a bus the march for trump bus and go across america and to take a little piece of everybody we came across and bring it here today to washington d.c like i said the president has not asked for much but he asked us to show up today and we showed up and we are not going to back down we're not going away you see republicans for years have been afraid of their own shadow they tuck tail and run anytime they see their shadow if nothing else what republicans should have learned is how to go on offense and win and fight back punch back from donald trump he doesn't back down he's not afraid of republicans he's not afraid of democrats he doesn't need anybody else's money he is fighting for me and you and americans across this country and he needs us now so for years as the republicans over at the capitol have been telling us they've been fighting for us what have they been doing they've been crafting the terms and finding a way our rights that's what they've been doing and they keep atta attacking our president and you know every time they attack him it's an attack on you and i and i don't know about you but i'm sick of it so we are here we're not going anywhere we're not going to let them steal an election because this isn't about stealing an election from donald j trump this is about stealing an election from we the people you guys we can not back down this is just the beginning we have a lot you we are not gonna back down are we keep up the fight keep fighting for america it's worth saving i don't know about you but i don't want to learn to speak chinese and i don't want that white house to turn red [Music] it is up to you and i to save this republic and i am committed to doing that and i look forward to working with all of you across this nation for the next two years and let republicans know we're coming for you and before i go i just want to thank the women for america first team they've done an amazing job they're not all up here today but we put in long hours on those buses four weeks on the buses spit christmas away from our families but it was all worth it we do it again in a heartbeat we're not going to stop fighting and we'll see you out on the trail god um [Music] ladies and gentlemen please welcome from the great state of georgia representative jones [Music] hello america i'm honored to be here today and i want you to know i stand tall and i stand firm and i'll stand with our president of the united states donald j trump [Music] he has been fighting for us he has been fighting for america and that's why we're here today to show him that we are going to fight we're going to send a message to joe biden nancy pelosi chuck schumer and the entire democratic party they don't know they just have awakened this party the gop is the grand old party but you know what we're about to make this we're going to bring in new ideas we're going to bring in brand new people and we're going to come in and we're we believe in the traditional values of the constitution we are going to protect all of our i am so fired up for what happened in country lincoln i'm ready to go home to the party

you've done to influence me to support me and give me the courage through my trials and tribulations i want to make clear about one thing donald trump has just begun i'm a part of his team and we're going to take back this country we're going to take back america peace out america now grab the general wait for the voice ladies and gentlemen please welcome general paxton it is so awesome to be here i want you to know 12 straight lawsuits related to mail-in ballots related to signature verification federal court state court travis county austin houston we fought we won every single one of those cases and because of that donald trump won and thank god for a legislature in texas like my senator angela paxton my wife who put in place laws that protect against fraud one of the great things about the state of texas is that we did not we did not quit if you look at what georgia did they capitulated they consented we kept fighting in texas and then we had the opportunity to go fight in other states and we sued four states over the ballot fraud and not following the constitution not following state law and we took it directly to the supreme court and they should have heard our case and let me just finish up by saying that what we have in president trump is a fighter and i think that's why we're all here we believe in what he's accomplished over the last four years we were and because we're here today the message goes on we will not quit fighting we're texans we're texans we're americans and we're not quitting god bless you for being here today god bless this great country

incredible country has ever seen he is a great patriot that is fought for the america first policies for the american dream for you and your families thank you president trump and we will continue to hold the line across this incredible country because we finally had a president in the white house that knows what it means to put america first a president that understands what it means to have open schools not open borders who restored the greatness of the american military who stands for veterans who stands for law enforcement and the american family he is the president that humiliated the democratic machine in 2016 and turned the swamp upside down and he will continue to fight for that dream he will continue to save america we will continue to stand for president trump stand with them

warm welcome and let's show the president when he comes how much we love him god bless america god bless our president and ladies and gentlemen the best is yet [Music] hello patriots hey guys you actually all did something i didn't realize was possible i'm looking at the crowd here and the tens of thousands probably hundred thousand plus people here and you did it all without burning down buildings you did it without ripping down churches without looting i didn't know that that was possible according to the media when you have a large gathering of peaceful protesters they're supposed to see guys we can do it right but the fact that you are all here on this rather cold january day tells me all i need to know and it should be a message to all the republicans who have not been willing to actually fight the people this gathering should send a message to them this isn't their republican party anymore this is the republican party that will put this is the republican party that will fight this is the republican party that's not just going to roll over and die no we've seen that guys we've seen that we've been our own worst enemy all you got to do is look to georgia where you had republicans saying well well i don't like the way the game is played so let's take our ball and go home no guys hey guess what that was music to chuck schumer's ears that was music to nancy pelosi's ears and that is what so many in the republican establishment have created that sort of mentality okay we'll turn the other cheek we'll roll over and die we'll fold and give up no more so to those republicans many of which may be voting on things in the coming hours you have an opportunity today you can be a hero or you can be a zero and the choice is yours but we are choose wisely because if you just roll over if you don't fight in the face of glaring impossibilities that's right guys that's the message these guys better fight for trump because if they're not guess what i'm gonna be in your backyard in a couple of months guys like scott here look at wow okay i can't go through the whole list because i don't have 45 minutes to go through all the patriots that have been fighting that have been on the ground that have mobilized to put good republicans in those positions guess what folks if you're gonna be the zero and not the hero we're coming for you and we're gonna have a good time doing it [Music] we gotta start fighting like the democrats do right we gotta play their game we gotta take their fight to them their way our reluctance to do that over the last few decades is why we are in the position that we are in friend or foe today republicans you get to pick a side for the future of this party again i suggest you choose wisely so kimberly thank you for all of your one of the great fighters out there uh to my family to my father but most importantly to all of you red-blooded patriotic americans thank you for being in this fight with us thank you for standing up to the right amen and and a woman right now yeah i know i know but but that shows you literally the mentality of where the democrat party is right i think i put it up on my instagram which is being censored to hell right now but like i put it up yesterday they spent money on a study that came to the incredible conclusion yesterday that trans women playing in female sports have a i had no idea i'm glad we spent probably millions figuring that out just like i'm thrilled that we spent 10 million to pakistan on gender studies and billions elsewhere on nonsense that is driven by the insanity of the left folks and we have to stand up for it no one cares how you identify but you don't have to do the nonsense that follows and what i want to know is in these sorts of things where are the people where are the feminists that we're fighting as men are dominating women's sports where are they folks we need to be the party of common sense we need to be the party of reason we need to be the party of our values that we hold so dear that made america the greatest country in the world and you guys are part of that movement so stay in this fight stay loud don't be suppressed don't be put in your corner don't let them cancel you trust me i've been canceled 17 times since i started once it happens it's rather freeing and you can kind of do what you want don't let them do it to you stand up and fight stand up and hold your representatives accountable and when you do we can keep america great thank you patriots thank you america keep fighting thank you guys [Music] [Music] please [Music] hello [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] do [Music] baby [Music] always man [Music] please [Music] mr hey all right [Music] uh is uh ladies and gentlemen please welcome congressman madison cawthorne wow this crowd has some fight in it i am so thankful that each and every single one of you come you know i just rolled down from the capitol building about two miles away down pennsylvania avenue and i will tell you the courage that i see in this crowd is not represented on that hill my friends i will tell you right now that there is a new republican party rising the founders of our great country saw to it that the people who consent to be governed should have a voice in that government but my friends the democrats with all the fraud they have done in this election the republicans hiding and not fighting they are trying to silence your voice make no mistake about it they do not want you to be heard but my friends when i look out this crowd i can confidently say there's a new republican party on the rise that will represent this country that will go and fight in washington d.c i'll tell you i see so many of my friends who are up in congress with me who are about to go back to that capitol hill and at 12 o'clock today we will be but my friends bear in mind there is a significant portion of our party that says we should just sit idly by and sit on our hands they have no backbone my friends i encourage you continue to make your voice heard because but my friends we're not doing this just for donald trump we are doing this for the constitution our constitution was violated you know if i knew that a city clerk in a city called with my name named madison can overturn a state legislator and alter the course of an election well hell i might have ran for a different office my friends i encourage you go back to your states after today hold your representatives accountable make sure that they stood up for election integrity my friends i want you to chant with me so loud that the cowards on washington dc that i serve with can hear you while i leave let's get a chance so donald trump knows who supports him usa usa usa usa usa usa is oh frankly senator sanders senator warren and myself are all on the same team what are you willing to sacrifice to make sure that over-funded police departments are deep funded there is no middle road on the climate crisis i not only support a green new deal i don't think it goes far enough i'm all for a green new deal this is part of what gun registration is about we want to track where the guns are we need to cut the defense budget are you in favor of expanding the court or perhaps an age limit in place instead of a lifetime appointment i've said everything is on the table but if we win the majority everything is on the table now we take georgia then we change america change is coming to america the blue wave is comprised of those who are documented and undocumented we win these races in georgia so that we don't have to negotiate that's their goal total radical control to bring horrific change to america only georgians can stop them nobody can serve god and the military rafael warnock attacks our military police power the kind of gangster and thug mentality warnock attacks our police somebody's gotta open up the jails raphael warnock is dangerous no wonder he defended this now america hope is that uh in early january democrats will pick up two more seats in the georgia runoffs uh and that will make our life a lot easier we need to send the message this year we need to send the message that if you indulge this kind of politics you're not you're going to get beaten so bad you can never run or show your face again in public because absolutely enough of what we are getting from donald trump you're not just gonna get beat you're gonna get beaten so bad he can never do [Music] me [Music] ladies and gentlemen please welcome america's mayor rudy giuliani accompanied by professor john eastman hello hello everyone we're here uh just very briefly to make a very important two points number one every single thing that has been outlined as the plan for today is perfectly legal i have professor eastman here with me to say a few words about that he's one of the preeminent constitutional scholars in the united states it is perfectly appropriate given the questionable constitutionality of the election counting act of 1887 that the vice president can cast it aside and he can do what a president called jefferson did when he was vice president he can decide he can decide on the validity of these crooked ballots or he can send it back to the legislatures give them 5 to ten days to finally finish the work we now have letters from five legislatures they're asking us georgia pennsylvania arizona wisconsin and one other coming in so it seems to me we don't want to find out three weeks from now even more proof that this election was stolen do we so it's perfectly reasonable and fair to get 10 days and you should know this the democrats and their allies have not allowed us to see one machine or one paper ballot now if they ran such a clean election why wouldn't they make all the machines if they ran such a clean election they'd have you come in and look at the paper ballots who hides evidence criminals hide evidence not honest people so over the next 10 days we get to see the machines that are crooked the ballots that are fraudulent and if we're wrong we will be made fools of but if we're right so let's have trial by combat i'm willing to state i'm willing to stake my reputation the president is willing to stake his reputation on the fact that we're going to find criminality there is joe biden willing to stake his reputation that there's no crime there no also last night one of the experts that has examined these crooked dominion machines has absolutely what he believes is conclusive proof that in the last 10 percent 15 percent of the vote counted the votes were deliberately changed by the same algorithm that was used in cheating president trump and vice president pence same algorithm same system same thing was done with the same machines you noticed they were ahead until the very end right then you noticed there was a little gap one was ahead by three percent the other was ahead by two percent and gone gone they were even he can take you through that and show you how they program that machine from the outside to accomplish that and they've been doing it for years to favor the democrats it is a matter of scientific proof we need two days to establish that it'd be a shame if that gets established this was the worst election in american history this election was stolen in its seven states they picked states where they had crooked democratic cities where they could push everybody around and it has to be vindicated to save our republic this is bigger than donald trump it's bigger than you and me it's about these monuments and what they stand for this has been a year in which they have invaded our freedom of speech our freedom of religion our freedom to move our freedom to live i'll be daunted that they're going to take away our free and and we're going to fight to the very end to make sure that doesn't happen let me ask professor eastman to explain as easily as we can i know this is complicated but what happened last night how they cheated and how it was exactly the same america's mayor wonderful sorry i had to say that look we've got petitions pending before the supreme court that identify in chapter and verse the number of times state election officials ignored or violated the state law in order to put vice president biden over the finish line we know there was fraud traditional fraud that occurred we know that dead people voted but we now know because we caught it live last time in real time how the machines contributed to that fraud and let me as simply as i can explain it you know the old way was to have a bunch of ballots sitting in a box under the floor and when you needed more you pull them out in the dark of night they put those ballots in a secret folder in the machines sitting there waiting until they know how many they need and then the machine after the close of polls we now know who's voted and we know who hasn't and i can now in that machine match those unvoted ballots with an unvoted voter and put them together in the machine and how do we know that happened last night in real time you saw when it got to 99 of the vote total and then it stopped the percentage stopped but the votes didn't stop what happened and you don't see this on fox or any of those stations but the data shows that the denominator how many ballots remain to be counted how else do you figure out the percentage that you have how many remain to be counted that number started moving up that means they were unloading the ballots from that secret folder matching them matching them to the unvoted voter and voila we have enough votes to barely get over the finish line we saw it happen in real time last night and it happened on november 3rd as well and all we are demanding of vice president pence is this afternoon at one o'clock he let the legislatures of the state look into this so we get to the bottom of it and the american people know whether we have control of the direction of our government or not [Applause] we no longer live in a self-governing republic if we can't get the answer to this question this is bigger than president trump it is the very essence of our republican form of government and it has to be done and anybody that is not willing to stand up to do it does not deserve to be in the office it is that simple and thank you so much for your support i know the courage it takes to be out there i know how you get ridiculed i know how they try to take jobs away from you but you look in the mirror every night and you say to yourself i'm doing the right thing for myself for my family for my children and most importantly for the united what truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people [Music] for too long a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost [Music] the establishment protected itself but not the

don't want to show that we have hundreds of thousands of people here and i just want them to be recognized by the fake news media turn your cameras please and show what's really happening out here because these people are not going to take it any longer they're not going to take it any longer go ahead turn your cameras please would you show they came from all over the world actually but i just really want to see what they do i just want to see how they're covered i've never seen anything like it but uh it would be really great if we could be covered fairly by the media the media is the biggest problem we have as far as i'm concerned single biggest problem the fake news and the big tech big tech is now coming into their own we beat them four years ago we surprised them we took them by surprise and this year they rigged an election they rigged it like they've never rigged an election before and by the way last night they didn't do a bad job either if you notice i'm honest and and i just again i want to thank you it's uh just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you and hundreds of thousands of american patriots are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our glorious republic all of us here today do not want to see your election victory stolen by emboldened radical left democrats which is what they're doing and stolen by the fake news media that's what they've done and what they're doing we will never give up we will never concede it doesn't happen you don't concede when there's theft [Applause] our country has had enough we will not take it anymore and that's what this is and to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with we will stop the steal [Applause] today i will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won it by a landslide this was not a close election you know i say sometimes jokingly but there's no joke about it i've been in two elections i won them both and the second one i won much bigger almost 75 million people voted for our campaign the most of any incumbent president by far in the history of our country 12 million more people than four years ago and i was told by the real pollsters we do have real pulses they know that we were going to do well and we were going to win but i was told if i went from 63 million which we had four years ago to 66 billion there was no chance of losing well we didn't go to 66 we went to 75 million and they say we lost we didn't lose and by the way does anybody believe that joe had 80 million votes does anybody he had 80 million computer votes it's a disgrace there's never been anything like that you could take third world countries just take a look take third world countries their elections are more honest than what we've been going through in this country it's a disgrace it's a disgrace even when you look at last night they're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off with boxes and nobody knows what the hell is going on there's never been anything like this we will not let them silence your voices and i'd love to have if those tens of thousands of people would be allowed the military the secret service and we want to thank you and the police law enforcement great you're doing a great job but i'd love it if they could be allowed to come up here with us is that possible can you just let them come up please he's got guts you know what he's got guts unlike a lot of people in the republican party he's got guts he fights he fights and i'll tell you thank you very much john fantastic job i watched that's a tough act to follow those two john is one of the most brilliant lawyers in the country and he looked at this and he said what an absolute disgrace that this could be happening to our constitution and he looked at mike pence and i hope mike is going to do the right thing i hope so i hope so because if mike pence does the right thing we win the election all he has to do all in this is this is from the number one or certainly one of the top constitutional lawyers in our country he has the absolute right to do it we're supposed to protect our country support our country support our constitution and protect our constitution states want to revoke the states got defrauded they were given false information they voted on it now they want to recertify they want it back all vice president pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president and you are the happiest people [Applause] and i actually i just spoke to mike i said mike that doesn't take courage what takes courage is to do nothing that takes courage and then we're stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that for four more years we're just not going to let that happen many of you have traveled from all across the nation to be here and i want to thank you for the extraordinary love that's what it is there's never been a movement like this ever ever for the extraordinary love for this amazing country by the way this goes all the way back past the washington monument do you believe this look at this they gave the press the prime seats i can't stand that no but you look at that behind i wish they'd flip those cameras and look behind you that is the most amazing sight when they make a mistake you get to see it on television and don't worry we will not take the name off the washington monument we will cancel culture you know they wanted to uh get rid of the jefferson memorial either take it down or just put somebody else in there i don't think that's going to happen it damn well better not although with this administration if this happens it could happen you'll see some really bad things happen they'll knock out lincoln too by the way they've been taking his statue down but then we signed a little law you hurt our monuments you hurt our heroes you go to jail for 10 years and everything stopped you notice that it stopped it all stopped and they could use rudy back in new york city rudy they could use you your city's going to hell they want rudy giuliani back in new york we'll get a little younger version of rudy is that okay rudy we're gathered together in the heart of our nation's capital for one very very basic and simple reason you know most candidates on election evening and of course this thing goes on so long they still don't have any idea what the votes are we still have congressional seats under review they have no idea they've totally lost control they've used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in a proper election but you know you know when you see this and when you see what's happening number one they also sir we'll never let it happen again i said that's good but what about eight weeks ago you know they try and get you to go they said sir in four years you're guaranteed i said i'm not interested right now do me a favor go back eight weeks i want to go back eight we want to go back and we want to get this right because we're to have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and we're not going to for years democrats have gotten away with election fraud and weak republicans and that's what they are there's so many weak republicans and we have great ones jim jordan and some of these guys they're out there fighting the house guys are fighting but it's uh it's incredible many of the republicans i help them get in i help them get elected i helped mitch get elected i helped i could name 24 of them let's say i won't bore you with it and then all of a sudden you have something like this that is like oh gee maybe i'll talk to the president sometime later no it's amazing the weak republicans they're pathetic republicans and that's what happens if this happened to the democrats there'd be hell all over the country going on there'd be hell all over the country but just remember this you're stronger you're smarter you've got more going than anybody and they try and demean everybody having to do with us and you're the real people you're the people that built this nation you're not the people that tore down our nation the weak republicans and that's it i really believe it i think i'm going to use the term the weak republicans you've got a lot of them and you've got a lot of great ones but you've got a lot of weak ones they've turned to bly eye even as democrats enacted policies that chipped away our jobs weakened our military threw open our borders and put america last did you see the other day where joe biden said i want to get rid of the america first policy what's that all about get rid of how do you say i want to get rid of america first even if you're gonna do it don't talk about it right unbelievable what we have to go through what we have to go through and you have to get your people to fight and if they don't fight we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight we primary them we're gonna we're gonna let you know who they are i can already tell you frankly but this year using the pretext of the china virus and the scam of mail-in ballots democrats attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft and there's never been anything like this it's a pure theft in american history everybody knows it that election our election was over at 10 o'clock in the evening we're leading pennsylvania michigan georgia by hundreds of thousands of votes and then late in the evening or early in the morning boom these explosions of and don't forget when romney got beat romney did you see his i wonder if he enjoyed his flight in last night but when romney got beaten you know he stands up like you're more typical well i'd like to congratulate the victor the victor who is the victor mitt i'd like to congratulate they don't go and look at the facts no i don't know he got he got slaughtered probably maybe it was okay maybe it was that's what happened but we look at the facts and our election was so corrupt that in the history of this country we've never seen anything like it you can go all the way back you know america is blessed with elections all over the world they talk about our elections you know what the world says about us now they say we don't have free and fair elections and you know what else we don't have a free and fair press our media is not free it's not fair it suppresses thought it suppresses speech and it's become the enemy of the people it's become the enemy of the people it's a it's the biggest problem we have in this country no third world countries would even attempt to do what we caught them doing and you'll hear about that in just a few minutes republicans are republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back it's like a boxer and we want to be so nice we want to be so respectful of everybody including bad people and we're going to have to fight much harder and mike pence is going to have to come through for us and if he doesn't that will be a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold now it is up to congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy and after this we're going to walk down and i'll be there with you we're going to walk down we're going to walk down anyone you want but i think right here we're going to walk down and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you'll never take back our country with weakness you strong have come to demand that congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated lawfully slated i know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard today we will see whether republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections but whether or not they stand strong for our country our country our country has been under siege for a long time far longer than this four year period we've set it on a much straighter course a much and we i thought you know four more years i thought it would be easy we created the greatest economy in history we rebuilt our military we get you the biggest tax cuts in history right we got you the biggest regulation cuts there's no president whether it's four years eight years or in one case more got anywhere near the regulation cuts used to take 20 years to get a highway approved now we're down to two i want to get it down to one but we're down to two and it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons but we got it down to safety we created space force we look at what we did our military has been totally rebuilt so we create space force which by and of itself is a major achievement for an administration and with us it's one of so many different things right to try everybody know about right to try we did things that nobody ever thought possible we took care of our vets our vets the va now has the highest rating 91 the highest rating that it's had from the beginning 91 approval rated always you watch the va it was on television every night people living in a horrible horrible manner we got that done we got accountability done we got it so that now in the va you don't have to wait for four weeks six weeks eight weeks four months to see a doctor if you can't get a doctor you go outside you get the doctor you have them taken care of and we pay the doctor and we've not only made life wonderful for so many people we've saved tremendous amounts of money far secondarily but we've saved a lot of money and now we have the right to fire bad people in the va we had 9 000 people that treated our veterans horribly in prime time they would not have treated our veterans badly but they treated our veterans horribly and we have what's called the account of a va accountability act and the accountability says if we see somebody in there that doesn't treat our vets well or they steal they rob they do things badly we say joe you're fired get out of here before you couldn't do that you couldn't do that before so we've taken care of things we've done things like nobody's ever thought possible and that's part of the reason that many people don't like us because we've done too much but we've done it quickly and we were going to sit home and watch a big victory and everybody had us down for a victory it was going to be great and now we're out here fighting i said to somebody i was going to take a few days and relax after our big electoral victory 10 o'clock it was over but i was going to take a few days and i can say this since our election i believe which was such a catastrophe when i watched and even these guys knew what happened they know what happened they're saying wow pennsylvania's insurmountable wow wisconsin look at the big leads we had right even though the press said we lose wisconsin by 17 points even though the press said ohio's going to be close we set a record florida's going to be close we set a record texas is going to be close texas is going to be close we set a record and we set a record with hispanic with the black community we set a record with everybody today we see a very important event though because right over there right there we see the event going to take place and i'm going to be watching because history is going to be made we're going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history throughout eternity they'll be ashamed and you know what if they do the wrong thing we should never ever forget that they did never forget we should never ever forget with only three of the seven states in question we win the presidency of the united states and by the way it's much more important today than it was 24 hours ago because and don't i spoke to david perdue what a great person and kelly lefler two great people but it was a setup and you know i said we have no back line anymore the only back line the only line of demarcation the only line that we have is the veto of the president of the united states so this is now what we're doing a far more important election than it was two days ago i want to thank the more than 140 members of the house those are warriors they're over there working like you've never seen before studying talking actually going all the way back studying the roots of the constitution because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was illegally gotten they gave these people bad things to vote for and they voted because what did they know and then when they found out a few weeks later again it took them four years to devise this screen and the only unhappy person in the united states single most unhappy is hillary clinton because she said why didn't you do this for me four years ago why didn't you do this for me four years ago change the votes 10 000 in michigan you could have changed the whole thing but she's not too happy you notice she you don't see her anymore what happened where's hillary where is she but i want to thank all of those congressmen and women i also want to thank our 13 most courageous members of the u.s senate senator ted cruz senator ron johnson senator josh hawley kelly laflin and kelly left i'll tell you she has been she's been so great she worked so hard so let's give her and david a little special head because it was rigged against him let's give her they fought a good race they never had a shot that equipment should never have been allowed to be used and i was telling these people don't let them use this stuff marsha blackburn terrific person mike braun indiana steve dames great guy bill hagerty john kennedy james lankford cynthia lumps tommy tuberville to the coach and roger marshall we want to thank them senators i actually think though it takes again more courage not to step up and i think a lot of those people are going to find that out and you better start looking at your leadership because your leadership has led you down the tubes you know we don't want to give two thousand dollars to people we want to give them six hundred dollars oh great how does that play politically pretty good and this has nothing to do with politics but how does it play politically china destroyed these people we didn't disrupt china destroyed them totally destroyed them we want to give them six hundred dollars and they just wouldn't change i said give them two thousand dollars we'll pay it back we'll pay it back fast you already owe 26 trillion give them a couple of bucks let them and some of the people here disagree with me on that but i just say look you got to let people live and how does that play though okay number one it's the right thing to do but how does that play politically i think it's the primary reason one of the primary reasons the other was just pure cheating that was the primary super primary reason but you can't do that got to use your head as you know the media has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence of widespread food you ever see these people while there is no evidence of fraud or really well i'm going to read you pages i hope you don't get bored listening to it promise don't get bored listening to it all those hundreds of thousands of people back there move them up please yeah all the all these people don't get bored don't get angry at me because you're gonna get bored because it's so much the american people do not believe the corrupt fake news anymore they have ruined their reputation but you know it used to be that they'd argue with me i'd fight so i'd fight that fight i'd fight that fight pop up you'd believe me you'd believe them somebody comes out you know they had their point of view i had my point of view but you'd have an argument now what they do is they go silent it's called depression and that's what happens in a communist country that's what they do they suppress you don't fight with them anymore unless it's a bad serve they have a little bad story about me they make it ten times worse and it's a major headline but hunter biden they don't talk about him what happened to hunter where's where is hunter they don't talk about them now watch all the sets will go off well they can't do that because they get good ratings their ratings are too good now where's hunter you know and and how come joe was allowed to give a billion dollars of money to get rid of the prosecutor in ukraine how does that happen i'd ask you that question how does that happen can you imagine if i've said that if i said that it would be a whole different ballgame and how come hunter gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of moscow's wife and gets hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on an energy board even though he admits he has no knowledge of energy and millions of dollars up front and how come they go into china and they leave with billions of dollars to manage have you managed money before no i haven't oh that's good here's about three billion no they don't talk about that no we have a corrupt media they've gone silent they've gone dead i now realize how good it was if you go back 10 years i realized how good even though i didn't necessarily love him i realized how it was like a cleansing motion right but we don't have that anymore we don't have a fair media anymore it's suppression and you have to be very careful with that and they've lost all credibility in this country we will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies that we've been forced to believe over the past several weeks we've amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election this is the presidential election last night was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state but they cheated like hell anyway you have one of the dumbest governors in the united states and you know when i endorsed him i didn't know this guy at the request of david perdue said friend of mine's running for governor what's his name and you know the rest he was in fourth place fifth place i don't know he was wait he was doing poorly i endorsed him he went like a rocket ship that he won and then i had to beat stacey abrams with this guy brian kemp i had to beat stacy abrams and i had to beat oprah used to be a friend of mine you know i was on her last show or last week she picked the five outstanding people i don't think she thinks that anymore once i ran for president i didn't notice there were too many calls coming in from oprah believe it or not she used to like me but i was one of the five outstanding people and i had a campaign against michelle obama and barack hussein obama against stacey and i had brian kemp he weighs 130 pounds he said he played offensive line in football i'm trying to figure that out i'm still trying to figure that out so that the other night i was his offensive lineman i'm saying really that but i look at that and i look at what's happened and he turned out to be a disaster this stuff happens you know look i'm not happy with the supreme court they love to rule against me i picked three people i fought like hell for them one in particular i thought they all said sir cut him loose he's killing the senators you know very loyal senators they're very loyal people sir cut him loose he's killing us sir cut him loose sir i must have gotten half of the senators i said no i can't do that it's unfair to him and it's unfair to the family he didn't do anything wrong they made up stories they were all made up stories he didn't do anything wrong caught a blue sir i said no i won't do that we got them through and you know what they couldn't give a damn they couldn't give a damn let them rule the right way but it almost seems that they're all going out of their way to hurt all of us and to hurt our country to hurt our country you know i read a story in one of the newspapers recently how i control the three supreme court justices i control them they're puppets i read it about bill barr that he's my personal attorney that he'll do anything for me and i said you know it really is genius because what they do is that and it makes it really impossible for them to ever give you a victory because all of a sudden billboard changed if you hadn't noticed i like bill barr but he changed because he didn't want to be considered my personal attorney and the supreme court they rule against me so much you know why because the story is i haven't spoken to any of them any of them since virtually they got in but the story is that they're my puppet right that they're puppets and now the only way they can get out of that because they hate that it's not good on the social circuit and the only way they get out is to rule against trump so let's rule against trump and they do that so i want to congratulate them but it shows you the media's genius in fact probably if i was the media i'd do it the same way i hate to say it but we got to get them straightened out today for the sake of our democracy for the sake of our constitution and for the sake of our children we lay out the case for the entire world to hear do you want to hear it in every single swing set local officials state officials almost all democrats made illegal and unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the mandated approvals by the state legislatures that these changes pave the way for fraud or to scale never seen before and i think we can go a long way outside of our country when i say that so just in a nutshell you can't make a change on voting for a federal election unless the state legislature approves it no judge can do it nobody can do it only a legislature so as an example in pennsylvania or whatever you have a republican legislature you have a democrat mayor and you have a lot of democrats all over the place they go to the legislature the legislature laughs at them says we're not going to do that they say thank you very much and they go and make the changes themselves they do it anyway and that's totally illegal that's totally illegal you can't do that in pennsylvania the democrat secretary of state and the democrat state supreme court justices illegally abolished the signature verification requirements just 11 days prior to the election so think of what they did no longer is their signature verification oh that's okay we want voter id by the way but no longer is there signature verification 11 days before the election they say we don't want it you know why they don't want to because they want to cheat that's the only reason who wouldn't even think of that we don't want to verify a signature there were over 205 000 more ballots counted in pennsylvania think of this you had 205 000 more ballots than you had voters that means you had two where did they come from you know where they came from somebody's imagination whatever they needed so in pennsylvania you had 205 000 more votes than you had voters and it's the number's actually much greater than that now that was as of a week ago and this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say it's a total fraud so pennsylvania was defrauded over 8 000 ballots in pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in 2020 and prior to the election think of that dead people lots of dead people thousands and some dead people actually requested an application that bothers me not only are they voting they want an application to vote one of them was 29 years ago died it's incredible over 14 000 ballots were cast by out of state voters so these are voters that don't live in the state and by the way these numbers are what they call outcome determinative meaning these numbers far surpass i lost by a very little bit these numbers are massive massive more than 10 000 votes in pennsylvania were illegally counted even though they were received after elected day in other words they were received after election day let's count them anyway and what they did in many cases is they did fraud they took the date and they moved it back so that it no longer is after election day and more than 60 000 ballots in pennsylvania were reported received back they got back before they were ever supposedly mailed out in other words you got the ballot back before you mailed it logically and logistically impossible right think of that one you got the ballot back let's send the ballot so they've already been sent but we got the ballot back before they were sent i don't think that's too good right 25 000 ballots in pennsylvania were requested by nursing home residents all in a single giant batch not legal indicating an enormous illegal ballot harvesting operation you're not allowed to do it's against the law the day before the election the state of pennsylvania reported the number of absentee ballots that had been sent out yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by 400 000 people it was increased nobody knows where it came from by 400 000 ballots one day after the election it remains totally unexplained they said well we can't uh figure that now that's many many times what it would take to overthrow the state just that one element 400 000 ballots appeared from nowhere right after the election by the way pennsylvania has now seen all of this they didn't know because it was so quick they had to vote they voted but now they see all this stuff it's all come to life it doesn't happen that fast and they want to re-certify their votes they want to re-certify but the only way that can happen is if and many people in congress want to send back and think of what you're doing let's say you don't do it somebody says well we have to obey the constitution and you are because you're protecting our country and you're protecting the constitution so you are but think of what happens let's say they're stiffs and they're stupid people and they say well we really have no choice even though pennsylvania and other states want to redo their votes they want to see the numbers they already have numbers go very quickly and they want to redo their legislature because many of these votes were taken as i said because it wasn't approved by their legislature you know that in itself is legal and then you have the scam and that's all of the things that we're talking about but think of this if you don't do that that means you will have a president of the united states for four years with his wonderful son you will have a president who lost all of these states or you will have a president to put it another way who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these states you will have an illegitimate president that's what you'll have and we can't let that happen these are the facts that you won't hear from the fake news media it's all part of the suppression effort they don't want to talk about it they don't want to talk about it in fact when i started talking about that i guarantee you a lot of the television sets and a lot of those cameras went off and that's a lot of cameras back there but a lot of them went off but these are the things you don't hear about you don't hear what you just heard and i'm going to go over a few more states but you don't hear it by the people who want to deceive you and demoralize you and control you big tech media just like the suppression polls that said we're gonna lose wisconsin by 17 points well we won wisconsin they don't have it that way because it was just by a little sliver they had me down the day before washington post abc paul down 17 points i called up a real pollster i said what is that sir that's called a suppression poll i think you're going to win wisconsin sir i said but why don't they make it four or five points because then people vote but when you're down 17 they say hey i'm not going to waste my time i love the president but there's no way despite that despite that we won wisconsin it's going to see i mean you'll see but that's called suppression because a lot of people when they see that it's very interesting this pulse has said sir if you're down three four five people vote when you go down 17 they say let's save let's go and have dinner and let's watch the presidential defeat tonight on television darling and just like the radical left tries to blacklist you on social media every time i put out a tweet that's even if it's totally correct totally correct i get a flag i get a flag and they also don't let you get out you know on twitter it's very hard to come onto my account it's very hard to get out a message they don't let the message get out nearly like they should but i've had many people say i can't get on your twitter i don't care about twitter twitter's bad news they're all bad news but you know what if you want to if you want to get out of message and if you want to go through big tech social media they are really if you're a conservative if you're a republican if you have a big voice i guess they call it shadow band right shadow band the shadow man you and it should be illegal i've been telling these republicans get rid of and for some reason mitch and the group they don't want to put it in there and they don't realize that that's going to be the end of the republican party as we know it but it's never going to be the end of us never let them get out let let the weak ones get out this is a time for strength they also want to indoctrinate your children in school by teaching them things that aren't so they want to indoctrinate your children it's all part of the comprehensive assault on our democracy and the american people are finally standing up and saying no this crowd is again a testament to it i did no advertising i did nothing you do have some groups that are big supporters i want to thank that amy and everybody we have some incredible supporters incredible but we didn't do anything this just happened two months ago we had a massive crowd come down to washington i said what are they there for sir they're there for you we have nothing to do with it these groups are for they're forming all over the united states and we got to remember in a year from now you're going to start working on congress and we got to get rid of the weak congress people the ones that aren't any good the liz cheney's of the world we got to get rid of them we got to get rid you know she never wants a soldier brought home 20 i brought a lot of our soldiers home i don't know somewhat like it they're in countries that nobody even knows the name nobody knows where they are they're dying they're great but they're dying they're losing their arms their legs their face i brought them back home largely back home afghanistan iraq remember i used to say in the old days don't go to wreck but if you go and keep the oil we didn't keep the oil so stupid so stupid these people and iraq has billions and billions of dollars now in the bank and what did we do we get nothing we never get but we do actually we kept the oil here or we can we did good we got rid of the isis caliphate we got rid of plenty of different things that everybody knows and the rebuilding of our military in three years people said it couldn't be done and it was all made in the usa all made in the usa best equipment in the world in wisconsin corrupt democrat-run cities deployed more than 500 illegal unmanned unsecured drop boxes which collected a minimum of 91 000 unlawful votes it was razor thin the loss just one thing alone is much more than we would need but there are many things they have these lock boxes and you know they'd pick them up and they'd disappear for two days people would say where's that box it disappeared nobody even knew where the hell it was in addition over 170 000 absentee votes were counted in wisconsin without a valid absentee ballot application so they had a vote but they had no application and that's illegal in wisconsin meaning those votes were blatantly done in opposition to state law and became 100 from democrat areas such as milwaukee and madison 100 in madison 17 000 votes were deposited in so-called human drop boxes you know what that is right where operatives stuff thousands of unsecured ballots into duffel bags on park benches across the city in complete defiance of cease and desist letters from state legislature your state legislature said don't do it they're the only ones that can approve it they gave tens of thousands of votes they came in in duffel bags where the hell did they come from according to eyewitness testimony postal service workers in wisconsin were also instructed to illegally backdate approximately 100 000 ballots the margin of difference in wisconsin was less than 20 000 votes each one of these things alone wins us the state great state we love the state we won the state in georgia your secretary of state who i can't believe this guy's a republican he loves recording telephone conversations you know that was a i thought it was a great conversation personally so did a lot of us people love that conversation because it says what's going on these people are crooked they're 100 in my opinion one of the most between the governor and your secretary of state and now you have it again last night just take a look at what happened what a mess and the democrat party operators entered into an illegal and unconstitutional unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other election security procedures stacy abrams she took them to lunch and i beat her two years ago with a bad candidate brian kell but they took the democrats took the republicans to lunch because the secretary of state had no clue what the hell was happening unless he did have a clue that's interesting maybe he was with the other side but we've been trying to get verifications of signatures in fulton county they won't let us do it the only reason they won't is because we'll find things in the hundreds of thousands why wouldn't they let us verify signatures in fulton county which is known for being very corrupt they won't do it they go to some other county where you would live i said that's not the problem the problem is fulton county home of stacy abrams she did a good job i congratulate her but it was done in such a way that we can't let this stuff happen we won't have a country if it happens as a result george's absency ballot rejection rate was more than 10 times lower than previous levels because the criteria was so off 48 counties in georgia with thousands and thousands of votes rejected zero ballots there wasn't one ballot in other words in a year in which more mail-in ballots were sent than ever before and more people were voting by mail for the first time the rejection rate was drastically lower than it had ever been before the only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the tally that's the only way you could explain it by the way you're talking about tens of thousands if georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots as in other years there should have been approximately 45 000 ballots rejected far more than what we needed to win just over 11 000 they should find those votes they should absolutely find that just over 11 000 votes that's all we need they defrauded us out of a win in georgia and we're not going to forget it there's only one reason the democrats could possibly want to eliminate signature matching oppose voter id and stop citizenship confirmation are you a citizenship you're not allowed to ask that question because they want to steal the election the radical left knows exactly what they're doing they're ruthless and it's time that somebody did something about it and mike pence i hope you're going to stand up for the good of our constitution and for the good of our country and if you're not i'm going to be very disappointed in you i will tell you right now i'm not hearing good stories in fulton county republican poll watchers were ejected in some cases physically from the room under the false pretense of a pipe burst water main burst everybody leave which we now know was a total lie then election officials pull boxes democrats and suitcases of ballots out from under a table you all saw it on television totally fraudulent and illegally scanned them for nearly two hours totally unsupervised tens of thousands of votes this act coincided with a mysterious vote dump of up to 100 000 votes for joe biden almost none for trump oh that sounds fair that was at 1 34 a.m the georgia secretary of state and pathetic governor of georgia have reached although he says i'm a great president you know i sort of maybe have to change he said the other day yes i go i disagree with president but he's been a great president okay thanks thank you very much because of him and others yeah brian kemp vote him the hell well his rates are so low you know his approval rating now i think it just reached a record low they've rejected five separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures in fulton county even without an audit the number of fraudulent ballots that we've identified across the state is staggering over 10 300 ballots in georgia were cast by individuals whose names and dates at birth match georgia residents who died in 2020 and prior to the election more than 2 500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in georgia prison people who are not allowed to vote more than 4 500 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state's own voter rolls over eighteen thousand illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant according to the postal service at least eighty eight thousand in georgia were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated 66 000 votes each one of these is far more than we need 66 000 votes in georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age and at least 15 000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to november third election they say they moved right back they moved right back oh they moved out they moved right back okay they missed george's that much i do i love georgia but it's a corrupt system despite all of this the margin in georgia is only 11 779 votes each and every one of these issues is enough to give us a victory in georgia a big beautiful victory make no mistake this election was stolen from you from me and from the country and not a single swing state had conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots this should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified in the state of arizona over 36 000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens 2 000 ballots were returned with no address more than 22 000 ballots were returned before they were ever supposedly mailed out they returned but we haven't mailed them yet 11 600 more ballots and votes were counted more than there were actual voters you see that so you have more votes again than you have voters 150 000 people registered in maya copa county after the registration deadline 103 000 ballots in the county were sent for electronic adjudication with no republican observers in clark county nevada the accuracy settings on signature verification machines were purposely lowered before they were used to count over 130 000 ballots if you signed your name as santa claus it would go through there were also more than 42 000 double votes in nevada over 150 000 people were hurt so badly by what took place and 1500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth matched nevada residents who died in 2020 prior to november third election more than 8 000 votes were cast by individuals who had no address and probably didn't live there the margin in nevada is down at a very low number any of these things would have taken care of the situation we would have won nevada also every one of these were going over we win in michigan quickly the secretary of state a real great one flooded the state with unsolicited mail-in ballot applications sent to every person on the rolls in direct violation of state law more than 17 000 michigan ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match people who were deceased in wayne county that's a great one that's detroit 174 000 ballots were counted without being tied to an actual registered voter nobody knows where they came from also in wayne county poll watches observed canvassers rescanning batches of ballots over and over again up to three or four or five times in detroit turnout was 139 of registered voters think of that so you had 139 of the people in detroit voting this is in michigan detroit michigan a career employee of the detroit city of detroit testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed city workers coaching voters to vote straight democrat while accompanying them to watch who they voted for when a republican came in they wouldn't talk to him the same worker was instructed not to ask for any voter id and not to attempt to validate any signatures if they were democrats she also told to illegally and was told back date ballots received after the deadline and reports that thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated that's michigan four witnesses have testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in detroit announced the last votes had been counted tens of thousands of additional ballots arrive without required envelopes every single one was for a democrat i got no votes at 6 31 a.m in the early morning hours after voting had ended michigan suddenly reported 147 000 votes an astounding 94 went to joe biden who campaigned brilliantly from his basement only a couple of percentage points went to trump such gigantic and one-sided vote dumps were only observed in a few sling states and they were observed in the states where it was necessary you know what's interesting president obama beat biden in every state other than the swing states where biden killed them but the swing states were the ones that mattered they're always just enough to push joe biden barely into the lead we were ahead by a lot and within a number of hours we were losing by a little in addition there is the highly troubling matter of dominion voting systems in one michigan county alone 6 000 votes were switched from trump to biden and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country senator william liggin a great gentleman chairman of georgia senate judiciary subcommittee senator liggin highly respected on elections has written a letter describing his concerns with dominion in georgia he wrote and i quote the dominion voting machines employed in fulton county had an astronomical and astounding 93.67 error rate it's only wrong 93 of the time in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voters interest in over 106 000 ballots out of a total of 113 000. think of it you go in and you vote and then they tell people who you're supposed to be voting for they make up whatever they want nobody's ever even heard they adjudicate your vote they say well we don't think trump wants to vote for trump we think he wants to vote for biden put it down for by the national average for such an error rate is far less than one percent and yet you're at 93 the source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or destroyed to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter the letter continues there is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from president trump to former vice president biden in several counties in georgia for example in bibb county president trump was reported to have 29 391 votes at 9 11 p.m eastern time while simultaneously vice president joe biden was reported to have seventeen thousand two thirteen minutes later just minutes at the next update these vote numbers switched with president trump going way down to seventeen thousand and biden going way up to twenty nine thousand three ninety one and that was very quick a twelve thousand vote switch all in mr biden's favor so i mean i could go on and on about this fraud that took place in every state and all of these legislatures want this back i don't want to do it to you because i love you and it's freezing out here but i could just go on forever i can so when you hear when you hear while there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing this is the most fraudulent thing anybody said this is a criminal enterprise this is a criminal enterprise and and the press will say and i'm sure they won't put any of that on there because that's no good have you ever seen while there is no evidence to back president trump's assertion i could go on for another hour reading this stuff to you and telling you about it there's never been anything like it think about it detroit had more votes than it had voters pennsylvania had 205 000 more votes than it had more but you don't have to go any that between that i think that's almost better than dead people if you think right more votes than the head voters and many other states also it's a disgrace that the united states of america tens of millions of people are allowed to go vote without so much as even showing identification in no state is there any question or effort made to verify the identity citizenship residency or eligibility of the votes cast the republicans have to get tougher you're not going to have a republican party if you don't get tougher they want to play so straight they want to play souls sir yes the united states the constitution doesn't allow me to send them back to this state well i say yes it does because the constitution says you have to protect our country and you have to protect our constitution and you can't vote on fraud and fraud breaks up everything doesn't it when you catch somebody in a fraud you're allowed to go by very different rules so i hope mike has the courage to do what he has to do and i hope he doesn't listen to the rhinos and the stupid people that he's listening to it is also widely understood that the voter roles are crammed full of non-citizens felons and people who have moved out of state and individuals who are otherwise ineligible to vote yet democrats oppose every effort to clean up their voter rolls they don't want to clean them up they're loaded and how many people here know other people that when the hundreds of thousands and then millions of ballots got sent out got three four five six and i heard one who got seven ballots and then they say you didn't quite make it sir uh we we won in a landslide this was a landslide they said it's not american to challenge the election this is the most corrupt election in the history maybe of the world you know you could go third world countries but i don't think they had hundreds of thousands of votes and they don't have voters for them i mean no matter where you go nobody would think this in fact it's so egregious it's so bad that a lot of people don't even believe it it's so crazy that people don't even believe it it can't be true so they don't believe it this is not just a matter of domestic politics this is a matter of national security so today in addition to challenging the certification of the election i'm calling on congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms and you better do it before we have no country left today is not the end it's just the beginning with your help over the last four years we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country and nobody even challenges that i say that over and over and i never get challenged by the fake news and they challenge almost everything we say but our fight against the big donors big media big tech and others is just getting started this is the greatest in history there's never been a movement like that you look back there all the way to the washington monument it's hard to believe we must stop this deal and then we must ensure that such outrageous election fraud never happens again can never be allowed to happen again but we're going forward we'll take care of going forward we got to take care of going back don't let them talk okay well we promise i've had a lot of people sir you're at 96 for four years i said i'm not interested right now i'm interested in right there with your help we will finally pass powerful requirements for voter id you need an id to cash your check you need an id to go to a bank to buy alcohol to drive a car every person should need to show an id in order to cast your most important thing a vote we will also require proof of american citizenship in order to vote in american elections we just had a good victory in court on that one actually we will ban ballot harvesting and prohibit the use of unsecured drop boxes to commit rampant fraud these drop boxes are fraudulent they're afraid they get they disappear and then all of a sudden they show up it's fraudulent we will stop the practice of universal unsolicited mail-in balloting we will clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who casts a vote is a citizen of our country a resident of the state in which they vote and their vote is cast at a lawful and honest manner we will restore the vital civic tradition of in-person voting on election day so that voters can be fully informed when they make their choice we will finally hold big tech accountable and if these people had courage and guts they would get rid of section 230 something that no other company no other person in america all of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections and it has to be stopped and the republicans have to get a lot tougher and so should the democrats they should be regulated investigated and brought to justice under the fullest extent of the law they're totally breaking the law together we will drain the washington swamp and we will clean up the corruption in our nation's capital we have done a big job on it but you think it's easy it's a dirty business it's a dirty business you have a lot of bad people out there despite everything we've been through looking out all over this country and seeing fantastic crowds although this i think is our all-time record i think you have 250 000 people 250 000 looking out at all the amazing patriots here today i have never been more confident in our nation's future well i have to say we have to be a little bit careful that's a nice statement but we have to be a little careful with that statement if we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country because it's illegal when the votes are illegal when the way they got there is illegal when the states that vote are given false and fraudulent information we are the greatest country on earth and we are headed and we're headed in the right direction you know the wall is built we're doing record numbers at the wall now they want to take down the wall let's let everyone float we did a great job in the wall remember the wall they said it could never be done one of the largest infrastructure projects we've ever had in this country and it's had a tremendous impact that we got rid of catch and release we got rid of all of the stuff that we had to live with but now the caravans they think biden's getting in the caravans are forming again they want to come in again and rip off our country can't let it happen as this enormous crowd shows we have truth and justice on our side we have a deep and enduring love for america in our hearts we love our country we have overwhelming pride in this great country and we have it deep in our souls together we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people by the people and for the people our brightest days are before us our greatest achievements still wait i think one of our great achievements will be election security because nobody until i came along had any idea how corrupt our elections were and again most people would stand there at nine o'clock in the evening and say i want to thank you very much and they go off to some other life but i said something's wrong here something's really wrong can't have happened and we fight we fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell you're not gonna have a country anymore our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun my fellow americans for our movement for our children and for our beloved country and i say this despite all that's happened we're going to walk down pennsylvania avenue i love pennsylvania and we're going to the capitol and we're going to try and give the democrats are hopeless they're never voting for anything not even one vote but we're going to try and give our republicans the weak ones because the strong ones don't need any of our help we're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country so let's walk down pennsylvania avenue i want to thank you all god bless you and god bless america thank you all for being here this is incredible thank you very much [Music] oh [Music] me uh [Music] me [Music] is [Music] me [Music] wow oh
