so we've been talking here a lot lately on rising about so-called cancel culture as you know we're generally not fans of that intolerance of dissent and a new piece journalist Matt Taibbi addresses the open letter that was in Harper's calling for the you oh I'm sorry not the Harper's letter calling for the removal of Harvard professor Steven Pinker from linguistic Society of America I'm getting all of my open letters confused here so Taibbi says that canceled culture stems from the 1960's liberation movements that shape the future of pop culture and academia and he joins us to share more on his reporting journalists in front of the show Matt Taibbi great to see you Matt I see Matt boring how are you doing alright take us through this latest addition to the conversation here yeah I talked to I did talk about the Harper's letter as well right it kind of happened at the same time so there was a group letter that was signed by over 500 academics denouncing Steven Pinker the linguistics professor at Harvard and it was really kind of amazing because what they basically did is they went through every statement he had ever made publicly and they read into basically five or six things that that was used to build a case that he was essentially racism adjacent and it was a very strange thing so I just sort of went point by point through each of the accusations one of them actually included that he had once retweeted David Brooks which I found very funny [Laughter] because it's sort of like a transitive property of cancellation yes what what they basically said is he retweeted David Brooks who once had an opinion that arguably was problematic on X score they even used that language could could be argued so if you have supported someone who did something that once could be argued was a problem then you're now responsible for all of that person's opinions and that's that's now an issue we are experts here on the transitive property of cancellation I do a whole sub-sect folks myself Matt one of the most fascinating insights I saw that you reacted to was from Wesley yang who also had on the show he says a problem with the letter is they would have not have been possible to mention even in passing the collapse of the Russia Gate narrative nor the reliance of other important narratives on provable falsehoods and get the hundred fifty-three signatories that they got and it reminds me of why somebody like you who spent so much time kind of you know debunking and going through the media failure on this can you help draw that that thread there of what it is how this was like the original sin kind of so to speak that led to the moment that we're in right now yeah actually I think that's a great point because for me a lot of this doesn't have anything to do with race it just has to do with the general it's sort of intellectual intolerance in this atmosphere that's been created around certain kinds of moral manias and the Russia Gates story was a classic example of that what ends up happening in these situations is if you have the wrong opinions about something and there's some very notable signatories who are absent from the letter and because I think because there were critics of the Russia Gates story what happens is once you are a critic of something that everybody else is in favor of the sort of egg factor gets thrown up around your personality and nobody wants to associate with you and it's it's sort of a disciplinary method that is used to keep people away from unorthodox opinions so only people like maybe Glenn Greenwald or myself or a few other folks were willing to come out and say publicly some things that were pretty obvious to a lot of reporters about the holes in that story but it was the fear of the social retribution and to a second secondary degree there the professional retribution that kept people away from saying certain things and that's what happens in in many contexts now and that's what Wesley was referring to I think well you know obviously here we have tremendous respect both for you and for Glenn and the courage that you've shown on that issue and on other issues as well but it's no accident that the two of you and others who were able to speak out in a courageous way on this issue we're people who basically already had established platforms right it's very hard to cancel Glenn Greenwald it's very hard to cancel Matt Taibbi and so even more pernicious is the effect that this has on people who are just starting out in the industry who are sort of mid-career just like coming out coming up in the profession that's where that chilling of descent is even more damaging and where if you dare you stick your head out you're really in trouble of having your entire career quashed yeah and this is where the criticism of the letter that I found really irritating was that oh look at it's people like Steven Pinker and Salman Rushdie and JK Rowling who could never be cancelled well that's the point they only people like that are gonna sign this letter for the most part right the the real damage of this new kind of thinking is for people who are not secure in their employment status because everybody sees these examples of people who are denounced through those who are the subject of letters and are cast out of their jobs and are basically unemployable going forward and so what ends up happening is people just stay as far as they possibly can from whatever they perceived the third rail to be and you end up getting this very cell to fiying intellectual culture and it's exemptible exemplified to me in the New York Times op-ed page right now which is basically a whole bunch of people agreeing with each other and no rostov hat right that's what you get and and that happens when everybody's afraid to be the first person to you know stop applauding at the at the ball basically right and man let's lay that out because what did what impact does this have on the future of media itself because on the one hand Chris and I were kind of like you know what maybe it's a good thing maybe it's a good thing that the mainstream media just is going to go all-in on this and have its own narrative so that people like you and us and others can rise up and just tell the truth on the other hand this is the destruction of a storied institution of we used to have a paper record in this country that had some semblance of trying to be fair represent the whole country not succumb to many of these campaigns that we're seeing how are you think about this as an independent journalist yourself yeah I mean I think it's gonna end up working out great for for people like me and for people like you and crystal but I think it's a real loss for the profession as much as I've criticized the New York Times over the years it is it wasn't and has been a very important institution in America just the sheer amount of resources that they were able to throw at certain issues just to be just to be able to count things like the damage that is done in wars and things like that right no one else has that kind of reach and what ends up happening it what people don't understand is the damage that's done by this is not to like say the conservative point of view the damage is actually done to the liberal minded readers and the people who work in these institutions because what when you don't have those other points of view that's when you make mistakes like 2016 when the New York Times completely missed the entire Trump phenomenon and come and miss called the election because they weren't in touch with what's going on in the rest of the country likey if you own if you have a monoculture within your newsroom that's when you're gonna be blind to important things and that is gonna really seriously damage the news gathering mission that your that is probably the first thing that's most important and what you're doing yeah can you speak directly to Barry Weiss saying she's self expelling from the New York Times I saw her and I talked about it here and the one criticism of the Harper's letter and the signatories on it that I thought was justified is to me the content of the letter was wholly like uncontroversial ultimately but people took issue with some of the signatories and in particular the part that I thought was legitimate was that some of them were rather hypocritical and one of the people that I pointed out and others at the time is Barry Weiss because she has not just when she was in college and she tried to get professors fired for their views there but she has continued that sort of direction of labeling people as anti-semitic to push them out of the public square she was involved a year ago and trying to deep platform a cartoonist so this seemed to me like right message but with her specifically wrong messenger I wanted to get your thoughts on that piece because I think part of what complicates the conversation is you have some people I certainly put yourself in this category who are trying to have a good-faith conversation about what this mean and means and what intolerance on the left in particular means for a liberal society and ideological diversity and then you have some people who are using it as sort of like a rhetorical weapon in order to try to make sure that their views go unchallenged but turn a blind eye when it's you know inconvenient views for their own perspective that are getting quashed yeah that's a great question I think if I had been in charge of putting together that letter I might have been a little bit more strategic about who I asked to sign the letter because there are a couple of people on there who have had particularly - I would say right there who have had issues in the past where they have specifically tried to do exactly what they're condemning in the letter all right so everybody immediately focuses on that and that does hurt the message of the letter ultimately I will say however though that the response the massive overweening focus on Barry Weiss I mean she was the number one thing trending on Twitter two days ago in America which is like unbelievable maybe considering all the stuff that's going on in the world there's there's a thing in there that I think is really important which is that when you start talking about issues in this country people are very reluctant to debate the ideas often they there's a new intellectual instinct to just say these are bad people these are good people that's the end of the conversation right we had this sort of asthma Nietzschean kind of an instinct to just put things in black and white and then we're talk about who's bad and who is good and what side were on and there's a lot of that that went on with this letter and I and I understand that for the that those names are a red flag to a lot of people but I think she's very much a part of that instinct right like she's very much one of the hardest positions to take in American politics and not get yourself cancelled is a pro-palestinian or a critique is real and she's very much part of architecting in modern American political life that structure that would say look these views over here you're not allowed to have them you're not allowed to talk about them or else you are bad you are evil you were anti-semitic and so that's why to me she in particular was a problematic messenger for this you know for this particular conversation yeah absolutely and and you know as as I've pointed out I've done a lot of writing in the let in the last two or three years about censorship and like the new instinct for it really the first people who end up being targeted in almost every new form of censorship are Palestinian activists right if you look at something like the you know the regulations on Facebook or the campaign's against what they call coordinated inauthentic behavior almost inevitably the first people the first Canaries in the coal mine are Palestinian activists who were sidelined right and it's institutional America is very very brutal on those people and same thing on campuses so you're absolutely right and again if if it had been me I probably would not have chosen certain people to be put on that list I do however understand why she was on the list because she does exemplify a little bit of that thing I was talking about before where we put Nick around people on Twitter and we used that to kind of shut down debate she's suspicious she's been icked probably as MIT as much as nearly everybody on Twitter except for maybe me and Glenn but but you know you know so I get it you know you're right we stand on this show with anyone who's great to have your insights thanks so much oh I'm authorizing for you after this
