About CiteIt
=============

Inspiration
-------------
**[CiteIt](https://www.citeit.net/)** is a project which allows web authors to demonstrate the 
context of their citations.  CiteIt was created by 
[Tim Langeman](http://www.openpolitics.com/tim) in 2015, 
and inspired by Ted Nelson.
The idea for the project arose while Tim was writing 
an article reviewing Ted Nelson's Ph.D thesis titled 
"[Philosophy of Hypertext](http://www.lulu.com/us/en/shop/theodor-holm-nelson/philosophy-of-hypertext/paperback/product-23052294.html)".

Who is Ted Nelson?
------------------
**[Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson)** is the person 
who coined the term "[hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext)" 
in 1962, and is most responsible for inspiring what what we today 
call the [world-wide-web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web),
which [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) 
created as a dumbed-down version of Nelson's proposal.

Nelson's original proposal for hypertext was more sophisticated than
the hypertext we have today.  As a longtime hypertext enthusiast, 
Tim Langeman created CiteIt to extend what is possible on the 
web to make it simulate something more akin to Nelson's vision.

Disclaimer: A Beginning
-------------------------
CiteIt is a continuation of the web's 
"[Worse is Better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better)" 
aproach to hypertext.  It is not Ted Nelson's design, 
but is hoped that by providing a glimpse of 
Ted's vision, others will be inspired to work towards 
the fuller Xanadu vision.
